Gambit is an open source tool used to aid in the computations involved in game theory.  It is limited to finite games, as well as games that are non-cooperative.

There appears to be high evidence of developer interest in the project.  The latest commit on the gambit github appears to be from six days ago.  There is work on the developer version, and per the gambit website the newest version is on track to be released in August of this year.  The developer is also a mentor in the 2014 Google Summer of Code, which also suggest recent developer interest.

User interest appears to be much more difficult to judge.  This program obviously fulfills a relatively niche need, and as such it could be expected to have a smaller user base.  The facebook page did have recent activity from users sharing the developer posts.  There also appear to have been about 200 downloads this week from the Gambit Sourceforge page.

There is documentation for each version of Gambit on the webpage for the project.  There are tutorials with examples on how to use the program.  There are tutorials on how to download the program, and even advice on how to contribute to Gambit.  There is a section describing how to report bugs, and it explains where one can find a list of known issues to work on.

The code does appear to be commented to some degree.  There appears to be a mix of C++, C and python, which was a bit confusing to me at first glance.  Per the website, the original library for representing games was written in the mid 90s, and as such it lacked some of the more modern C++ features.  One of the possible projects listed on the site was refactoring the current code into separate components and then using the more modern functionality to enhance what those components can do.  This could suggest that the current code is less than optimally organized.

The developers do have a bug submission procedure in place.  They also offer various programing guidelines on the developer portion of the website.  They offer mailing lists for any questions regarding development (and another mailing list for questions on using Gambit).  They offer both a developer version and a stable version, and have a development schedule in place.

There appears to be a wide variety of methods one can assist the project in.  The Gambit website has a page devoted to possible developer ideas.  The github repository has a list of known issues, and even some marked as easy for those who would like an entry level project to become acquainted with the code.

The emphasis placed on providing possible contributors with ideas, as well as the existence of ideas specifically marked as easy suggests that this might be a good way for an entry level programer such as myself to contribute to a project.
